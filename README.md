# Super simple traffic monitoring prototype
Implemented to learn how to use external APIs to retrieve live data in JSON format, decode it and present it to the user accordingly.

The prototype should retrieve all traffic incidents in a specified city and display them as blue dots on the map. In addition, a table containing more information is presented at the bottom of the page.

If no information is retrieved, it's probably because the API key is no longer valid. It should be replaced by a new one.
